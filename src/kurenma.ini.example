#
#  DESCRIPTION
#
#    main configuration file of kurenma(7) package. It defines the behavior of
#    the service - a client or server, sets the network settings and using
#    OpenSSL keys.
#
#  NOTES
#
#    The file consists of sections and parameters. A section begins with the
#    name  of  the section in square brackets (or top of the file for global
#    unnamed section) and continues until the next section  begins.  Unnamed
#    section  contain  global  settings.  Sections contain parameters of the
#    form:
#
#    name = value
#
#    or for some special sections contain sequence of "raw" lines,  each  of
#    which  is  a  unnamed  parameter.  For  example,  list  of allowed IPv4
#    networks (CIDR)
#
#    Section and parameter names are case sensitive.
#
#    Any line beginning with a hash ("#") character is ignored, as are lines
#    containing only whitespace.
#
#  PARAMETERS
#
#    There are three special sections, unnamed global, [ssl] and [ipsAllowed]
#
#    GLOBAL UNNAMED SECTION contain global named parameters:
#
#    role constant STRING
#        This parameter can be set to client or server and define  the  role
#        of  kurenmad(8).  Service  for client role send requests for tunnel
#        creating to the server and check tunnel state, for  server  role  -
#        listen client requests for tunnel creation only.
#
#    dev STRING
#        this parameter define WireGuard tunnel device name
#
#        Default: wg0
#
#    host STRING
#        this  parameter define valid hostname or IPv4 address of the server
#        side of kurenmad(8)
#
#    port NUMBER
#        UDP port number that the WireGuard device of the "server" role will
#        listen on
#
#        Default: 12912
#
#        It  makes  sense only for "server" role because the client receives
#        the port number on a successful key exchange.
#
#    portAuth NUMBER
#        TCP port number that the daemon of the "server" role will listen on
#        for auth and key exchange
#
#        Default: 42912
#
#    tsKeepalive NUMBER
#        Number  parameter  (0..65535)  of  time  interval  in seconds. This
#        option supported Wireguard option  "PersistentKeepalive"  for  keep
#        connection when peer is behind NAT or a firewall, see wg(1)
#
#        Default: 0 (disabled)
#
#    tsPeer￼Timeout Formatted STRING or NUMBER
#        Threshold  time  of  inactivity,  that  is  recognized  as  a  peer
#        disconnect
#
#        This parameter can be presented as a number (of seconds)  or  as  a
#        presentation time string "number<sec|min|hour|day|week|month|year>"
#
#        Default: 32minutes
#
#    ipServer IP address
#        Tunnel IP address of server peer.
#
#        It  makes  sense  only  for  "server" role. The client receives the
#        server tunnel IP-address in the key exchange
#
#        Default: 192.168.29.1
#
#    ipClient constant STRING
#        Leased mode for client peers. This parameter can be set to  dynamic
#        or commonname
#
#        It makes sense only for "server" role.
#
#        dynamic  -  set  for  client  peer  first  free  IP  address  after
#        "ipServer" value
#
#        commonname - set for client peer  IP  address  that  resolved  from
#        their  Common  Name  (CN).  In  this  case, the DNS service must be
#        properly configured.
#
#        Default: dynamic
#
#    SECTION [ipsAllowed] are given sequence of networks (CIDR) permitted to
#        WireGuard tunnel.
#
#    SECTION [ssl] should contain Сommon Names of peers that bind X.509
#        digital certificates of public key infrastructure (PKI)
#
#    cnServer STRING
#        Common Name (CN) that refers to the signed server certificate
#
#    cnClient STRING
#        Common Name (CN) that refers to the signed client certificate
#        It makes sense only for "client"  role.  The  server  receives  the
#        client's CN in the key exchange
