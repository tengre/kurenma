 - use global variable _kurenmas_ctl for daemonize with systemd
 - if latest-handshake of peer equal 0 then peer do not removed
 - used {try,catch}-every-line block for tunnel init
 - udfMakeFifo - make pipe in /var/run/kurenma

   port and key exchange process is repeated until a successful attempt
 - added support for options bDaemonize, bDefaultRoute, tsPeerTimeout and
   tsKeepalive from client.kurenma.ini:
   - tsPeerTimeout - max time without handshake, used human readable format

   - bDefaultRoute for set default route via WireGuard tunnel
   - tsKeepalive for persistent-keepalive options of WireGuard
 - restarts connection if there are no a handshake with the server during the
   time "tsPeerTimeout" in idle mode

 - added locking (flock) with special lock file, used timeout based locking for
   inclusion client IP to firehol "white" list. Locking activated by reexec with

     finds IP by using the 'Common Name' of the client as FQDN ('commonname')
   - client gets previously leased IP (if it is available) after reconnection in
     the 'dynamic' mode. This address temporary binded to the client certificate

   - ca                - make CA files and infrastructure
   - crt <Common Name> - make key and certificate files for client or server
 - openssl configurations saved to ../ssl/configs, CSR files saved to ../ssl/csr
