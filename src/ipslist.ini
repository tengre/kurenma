#
#  DESCRIPTION
#
#    helper configuration file for generate persistent white and black lists of
#    IP-addresses for firehol(1).
#    ipslist.ini is an INI file with two sections - lists of IP addresses or
#    domain names:
#
#       [ ipv4 white list ] - permitted
#
#       [ ipv4 black list ] - forbidden
#
#  NOTES
#
#    The file consists of sections and parameters. A section begins with the
#    name of the section in square brackets and  continues  until  the  next
#    section  begins or file ends. Sections contain sequence of "raw" lines,
#    each of which is a unnamed parameter.
#
#    Section and parameter names are case sensitive.
#
#    Any line beginning with a hash ("#") character is ignored, as are lines
#    containing only whitespace.
#
