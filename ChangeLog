	New upstream release
	Version 0.2
 - binded peer properties to 'Common Name' of the peer certificate
 - prevented running multiple instances of the peers
 - enabled run instances of the peers only from root
 - server side runned as service by endless loop around of netcat:
   * stdin and stdout of netcat looped through a named pipe
   * added function udfWaitRequest to control the netcat
   * used PKCS7 format for initial key exchange
   * input stream more than 64 lines discarded
   * added function udfHandleRequest for Wireguard tunnel creation
   * used stderr for logging, applies 1-5 levels of messages
   * added new function udfSelfCheck for cleaning unexpected long connection
     with the client
   * server gives first free IP for client (option 'dynamic' - default), or
     finds IP by using the 'Common Name' of the client as FQDN ('commonname')
   * client gets previously leased IP (if it is available) after reconnection in
     the 'dynamic' mode. This address temporary binded to the client certificate
   * added handling of section 'ipsAllowed' for getting list of allowed hosts
     and networks
   * added cleaning Wireguard peers with empty allowed-ips
 - added new configuration dn.kurenma.ini to determine the Distinguished Name of
   the Center of Authority (CA) and defaults values for client and server certs
   generation.
 - used single script gen-ssl-kurenma for keys and certs generation:
   * ca                - make CA files and infrastructure
   * crt <Common Name> - make key and certificate files for client or server
 - openssl configurations saved to ../ssl/configs, CSR files saved to ../ssl/csr
 - used knock to start peers handshaking from client
 - added function udfGetValidIPsOnly for IP validating
 - added support for wireguard option 'persistent-keepalive' by using ini config
   option 'keepalive'
